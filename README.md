# RealEstateManagement

**Description**

The project is a **Real Estate Management System** built in C++. It has a simple menu interface that lets users manage properties and listings. Users can either log in or register, with their credentials securely stored in a file. Once logged in, they can do things like add properties, view property details, search for properties, add listings, and see existing listings. Right now, the main features are very simple, but the system is set up to be easily expanded with more functionality later on.

**Features**
- User Login and Registration ( saved in credentials.txt )
- Add, Remove, Modify property abilities for those registered as "Agent"
- Reserve and View Reserved Properties for those registered as "Customer"
- View and Search properties for all users
